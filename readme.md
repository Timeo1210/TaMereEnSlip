# Backend

### 1. Informations
This Backend project use some environment variables
For Development save theses in */backend/.env*
For Production save theses in */backend/production.env*

##### Here is the variables :

```
DATABASE_URL=[mongodb_database_link] //mongodb://localhost/TaMereEnSlip
PORT=[port_of_server] // 4999
BACKUP_ENDPOINT=[backup_server_url] // http://255.255.255.255:4998
BACKUP_PASSWORD=[backup_server_password] // randompassword
```

**DATABASE_URL** : Is your mongodb database url
**PORT**: Is your backend server port that will exposed
**BACKUP_ENDPOINT**: Is your [Backup Server](#backup) url
**BACKUP_PASSWORD**: Is the password of the [Backup Server](#backup)

This project has a script to get automatically the server IP
*Refer you to the sixth point for more informations*

### 2. Development Installation

**MONGODB need to installed on your device**

Use this commands to install the development server:

```
npm install
```

### 3. Production Installation

**docker and docker-compose need to installed on your prod server**

##### You first need to build image of the project:
```
// in /backend folder
docker build .
docker tag [imageID] app:[project_version]
```
*You can save the image and export to your prod server and load after the image*
*Most importante thing is to have the tag attributs for the docker-compose.yml file*

##### Then edit docker-compose.yml file :

This is an example of the docker-compose.yml file content:
```
version: "3"
services: 
    app:
        container_name: app
        restart: always
        image: app:0.1.0
        env_file: 
            - production.env
        ports: 
            - "4999:4999"
        links: 
            - mongo
    mongo:
        container_name: mongo
        image: mongo
        volumes: 
            - ./data:/data/db
        expose: 
            - 27017
        ports: 
            - "27017:27017"
```

If you have change the port in the env don't forget do change it in this file

In resume that are the change that you can make
```

        env_file: 
            - [PathToEnvFile]
        ports: 
            - "[PORT]:[PORT]"
        links: 
            - mongo
    mongo:
        container_name: mongo
        image: mongo

        expose: 
            - 27017
